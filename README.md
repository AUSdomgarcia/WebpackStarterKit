# Webpack starter kit

> Baseline configuration for Webpack

Takes HTML, CSS, and JS files (`web/`) and compiles them (`public/`) using [Webpack]. This is the [webpack.config.js] that I usually start with in new projects.

[Webpack]: https://webpack.github.io/
[webpack.config.js]: webpack.config.js

## Features

- JavaScript via Babel
- CSS with [cssnext]
- HTML
- Images
- Webpack dev server
- LiveReload

Not present: tests, React, hot module reloading

[cssnext]: http://cssnext.io/

## Installation

```sh
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstacruz/webpack-starter-kit/master/_extras/install.sh | bash
```
